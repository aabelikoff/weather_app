# weather_app
This is my exam project which I held as the exam after JS course. It has been created on vanilla JS, HTML-5 and CSS-3. I used some API for developing, such as OpenWeatherMap (https://openweathermap.org/api), geolocation API (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API), IpAPI (https://ipapi.com/).
